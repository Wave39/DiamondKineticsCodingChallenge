# Diamond Kinetics Coding Challenge
This is a solution to the Diamond Kinetics Coding Challenge, written in Swift and utilizing an Xcode 10.3 Mac playground.

It has not been tested on versions of Xcode earlier than 10, or on versions of Swift earlier than 5.

Also, please keep in mind that Swift playgrounds do run much slower than normal Swift code, especially so in this case
with the long strings of numeric data that is parsed to feed into the search functions.
